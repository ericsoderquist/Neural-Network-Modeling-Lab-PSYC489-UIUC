## Introduction

This repository contains a robust and optimized implementation of a Simple Hopfield Network. Written in Python, the codebase adheres to best practices in software engineering and machine learning.

---

## Motivation

The Simple Hopfield Network is a foundational model in neural network theory with applications in associative memory and optimization problems. This codebase aims to offer a concise yet thorough implementation.

---

## Theoretical Background

A Hopfield Network is a recurrent artificial neural network serving as an associative memory system. It comprises a single layer where each neuron is fully interconnected with every other neuron. The network is trained to store binary patterns, evolving its state towards one of these patterns based on initial conditions.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy

---

## File Structure

- `Hopfield-Network.py`: This Python script includes the implementation of a Simple Hopfield Network.
    - Methods: `__init__`, `train`, `recall`

---

## Methods Overview

- `__init__`: Initializes the Hopfield Network architecture with error handling for input validation.
- `train`: Trains the network on a set of patterns, with input validation and error handling.
- `recall`: Recalls or reconstructs patterns based on trained patterns, also with input validation and error handling.

---

## Usage

To run the Simple Hopfield Network script:

```bash
python Hopfield-Network.py
```

---

## Performance Metrics

- Hamming Distance
- Recall Success Rate
